Hi there! I am Piyush. I am an entrepreneur with a couple of scar marks, a developer with over 4 yrs of experience in software development (backend and infra) and a dreamer who is living in the future. 
I am always experimenting with ideas or building something. I live by the moto <i>fail fast, fail often</i>. Whatever I learn is just kept in a bookmark, notion page or google docs somewhere, only
to be never revisited again. My aim with this website is to share my life experiences, learnings and milestones with the world, and with my future self.

Have any feedback, queries or just want to in touch. Drop me an email, always happy to connect!
