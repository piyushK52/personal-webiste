AI research is going so fast that even the adult industry is having a tough time catching up. Every day there's a brand new paper on different AI architecture and yesterday I saw a paper by HuggingFace for a model that can communicate with all the different models present on the platform and with time will learn what model to use with what query. It's moving fast enough to convince many top tech people that we will reach AGI in the next 5 years! that's wild. Although I feel we might still have a decade or so before we reach there, but we can definitely get pretty close in the next couple of years.

So what's next in AI? I believe the next goal is to make it much more integrated into our life. We want AI to take care of our finances, groceries, research, entertainment, and life in general. We want a PERSONAL ASSISTANT in our pocket. There will be a unified layer that will communicate through all the different oracles and entities on our behalf of us. For this layer to be personal and intimate, it can't be just any other piece of technology it has to feel personal. OpenAI has figured this out and is going for the takedown.

You must be thinking, but wait a minute OpenAI doesn't have an AI with personality. I think it's going to have one very soon. Look at the tweet below.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Startups developing AI characters lookout. Filled this OpenAI survey and I think I know what&#39;s next. <a href="https://t.co/uStZNpLLUg">pic.twitter.com/uStZNpLLUg</a></p>&mdash; Piyush Kumar (@thisispiyushK) <a href="https://twitter.com/thisispiyushK/status/1644247755483754496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Obviously, there won't be just one company with this powerful AI, and seeing the pace of development it is very much possible that developers would be able to create their own AI for niche use cases. The good strategy therefore could be to aggregate these niche AIs on a single platform. This marketplace won't be competing with the likes of OpenAI, Meta, or Google. Quora released it's own platform [Poe](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/06/quora-opens-its-new-ai-chatbot-app-poe-to-the-general-public/) a couple of months back and recently [Fixie](https://www.fixie.ai/), a startup in the similar direction picked up $17 million in funding

Who wins the AI wars is yet to be seen. It could very easily be the case that going above the current reasoning capacity of GPT-4 is not even possible with neural nets or that the entire internet's data is not enough to train the next big AI. I will be following this space and will be sharing some small projects that I am building along the way.
